    "### Classical vs Quantum Information\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Classical Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_information_theory)** - Think about how a CD or DVD stores music and videos. The disc surface contains tiny physical pits — a pit represents a 0, and a flat area (called a \"land\") represents a 1. When you play the disc, a laser reads these pits one by one, [decoding the binary data sequentially.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/compact-disc) This is how classical computers work: they process information as definite 0s and 1s, checking each value individually. If you wanted to find out whether a mystery function always gives the same answer (constant) or gives a mix of answers (balanced), you would have to test many inputs one at a time — potentially needing up to 9 queries for a 4-input function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Quantum Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information)** - Now imagine you need to decide whether to bring a raincoat before going outside. Classically, you would check the weather forecast first, then decide. But what if you could somehow be prepared for all weather possibilities at once? This is the essence of [quantum superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition) — a **[quantum bit (qubit)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit)** can exist as both 0 AND 1 simultaneously, like being in a state of \"maybe rain, maybe sunshine\" until you observe it. The [Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9708016) exploits this property: by putting qubits into superposition, we can query a function with all possible inputs at once, and through **[quantum interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference#Quantum_interference)**, the answer (constant or balanced) reveals itself in just a single query. This is the **[quantum advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy)** we will explore in this notebook.\n"

    "\n",
    "**What are Variadic Functions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **[variadic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_function)** is a function that accepts an arbitrary (variable) number of arguments. In languages like **[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))**, you typically must declare the exact number and type of arguments in the function signature (e.g., `int i, char c, char* s`). However, some functions—such as C's famous `printf`—can accept any number of arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference:** The concept of variadic functions dates back to early programming languages and is essential for flexible APIs. C's `printf` function is perhaps the most well-known example, using **[variable argument lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stdarg.h)** (`<stdarg.h>`) to handle formatting strings with any number of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python's `*args` Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides syntax for creating variadic functions using the **asterisk operator (`*`)** before an argument name. The most common convention is to name this parameter `*args`, though any valid name can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "- The `*` prefix tells Python to collect all positional arguments into a **[tuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple)**\n",
    "- Inside the function, `args` becomes a tuple containing all the passed arguments\n",
    "- You can pass any number of arguments (including zero)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple demonstration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function(*args):\n",
    "    print(args)\n",
    "\n",
    "function(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference:** This syntax is part of Python's **[argument unpacking](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#unpacking-argument-lists)** features, documented in **[PEP 3132](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3132/)** and extensively covered in resources like **[Real Python's guide to *args and **kwargs](https://realpython.com/python-kwargs-and-args/)**.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Packing (in function definitions):** `def f(*args)` — collects multiple arguments into one tuple\n",
    "2. **Unpacking (in function calls):** `f(*my_list)` — expands a list/tuple into separate arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "This second use is sometimes called the **\"explosion operator\"** because it \"explodes\" a collection into individual elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",

    "    return a + b + c\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "result = add_three(*numbers)  # Same as add_three(1, 2, 3)\n",
    "```\n",

    "#### Closures and Passing Function Objects\n",

    "**Closures in Asynchronous Programming**\n",
    "\n",
    "In JavaScript, when you set up an **[AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming))** call to communicate with a network server, the operation is asynchronous—meaning the JavaScript interpreter doesn't stop and wait for the response. Instead, you pass a **function object** to the AJAX call, and once the network request completes, that function will be called automatically. The tricky part is that you're not calling the function yourself from your own code—you're handing the function object over to the AJAX mechanism. This means you can't simply say \"here are the arguments I want to pass into that function\" at the time you set up the AJAX call.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference:** This callback pattern is fundamental to JavaScript's **[event-driven architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming)** and asynchronous I/O model (see [MDN Web Docs: Introducing asynchronous JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Introducing)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to use a **[closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming))**—you construct a function that already has all the values it needs captured from the surrounding scope. For example, if you have a list of items in JavaScript and you want to run an AJAX call for each one, then put the result into the list item at a specific index (A, B, C, etc.), you typically create a closure that captures that index value. When the AJAX call completes and your callback function runs, it still \"remembers\" which index it was supposed to update, even though the loop that created it has long since finished executing. This is exactly what closures are for—preserving state across asynchronous boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference:** The closure captures variables by reference to their lexical scope, a concept rooted in **[lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus)** and formalized in languages like Scheme before becoming standard in JavaScript (see [Understanding JavaScript Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)).\n",

    "- It accepts any number of boolean/truthy values\n",
    "- The function works for 1 bit, 3 bits, 4 bits, or any $n$ bits\n",
    "- This flexibility is essential for the quantum oracle abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accepts variadic input:** `*args` collects all binary arguments into a tuple\n",
    "2. **Converts to binary string:** Each argument is evaluated as truthy (→ '1') or falsy (→ '0')\n",
    "3. **Parses as integer:** The binary string is converted to a decimal index using `int(bits, 2)`\n",
    "4. **Returns the index:** This index is used to look up the oracle's output in the pre-generated tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bin_args_to_int(1, 0, 1)  # Args: (1, 0, 1)\n",
    "# → bits = '101'\n",
    "# → int('101', 2) = 5\n",
    "# → returns 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical notes:**\n",
    "- Closure pattern: `f_a` is fixed when `fclosure` is called; the returned `f` uses that fixed tuple, modeling an oracle.\n",
    "- Indexing convention: the first argument corresponds to the most-significant bit in the binary string; maintain this ordering consistently.\n",
    "- The variadic design allows the same `bin_args_to_int` function to work with any $n$-bit oracle without modification."

    "\n",
    "**What is a Closure?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a **[closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming))** is typically a function defined inside another function. This inner function grabs the objects defined in its enclosing scope and associates them with the inner function object itself. The resulting combination is called a closure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference:** From **[Python Closures: Common Use Cases and Examples](https://realpython.com/inner-functions-what-are-they-good-for/#closures-and-factory-functions)** on Real Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The `fclosure` Function Explained**\n",
    "\n",
    "The outer function is called `fclosure`. This is the function that returns a randomly selected function `f`. When you call `fclosure`, it returns a function that represents a random constant or balanced oracle. The pattern in the code above works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `f_a = random_tuple(n)` — Generate a random constant or balanced tuple of length $2^n$\n",
    "2. Define an inner function `f(*args)` that takes n binary arguments\n",
    "3. The inner function uses `bin_args_to_int(*args)` to convert arguments to an index\n",
    "4. It returns the element at that index from `f_a`\n",
    "5. Return the inner function `f` (the closure)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It's Called a Closure**\n",
    "\n",
    "The tuple `f_a` is created and gets its values in `fclosure` before you ever start talking about the inner function `f`. But notice how `f_a` is used inside the inner function `f`. This is technically interesting because we return `f` at the end of the outer function. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you call `fclosure`, it runs and finishes—it doesn't stay alive. Normally, when a function runs and then dies, all the local variables inside die too. You don't expect local variables in a function to hang around after the function has finished running.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Key Question: Why Does `f_a` Survive?**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call the returned function `f`, it still has access to `f_a` even though `fclosure` has finished executing. It doesn't throw an error saying \"I can't find `f_a`\". Why? Because everything in Python is an **[object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science))**, and objects live on as long as something is pointing to them. This is part of Python's **[garbage collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science))** mechanism, similar to Java's model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference:** Python's execution model and memory management follow the **[reference counting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting)** principle: as long as something is pointing at an object, it doesn't get garbage collected. Only when all references are removed does the object become eligible for cleanup (see [Python Data Model](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of `f_a` as a reference. The inner function `f` is pointing at whatever tuple `f_a` refers to. Python doesn't worry about dereferencing or pointer arithmetic like in C—you don't need the `*` dereference operator or anything like that. Because `f` is pointing at the tuple through `f_a`, and because `f` itself is returned from `fclosure` and kept alive by the caller, the tuple remains accessible. The inner function `f` is now a reference to whatever that tuple is, and `f` keeps a reference to `f_a`, so the garbage collector knows to keep everything around.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why the Name \"Closure\"?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's called a closure because the inner function \"closes over\" variables from the outer function and lives on past the outer function's execution, using values that were originally created in that outer scope. This is a huge idea in programming language theory, particularly in **[functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)** and languages derived from **[Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language))** and **[Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language))**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define a random constant or balanced function taking three binary arguments\n",
    "f = fclosure(3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Try an input on f\n",
    "f(1, 1, 0)  # Returns 0 or 1 depending on the random tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "# This doesn't give the game away - you can't see f_a\n",
    "f  # Shows: <function __main__.fclosure.<locals>.f(*args)>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you look at `f`, it just shows that it's a local function defined inside `fclosure`, but you can't directly access `f_a` to see what the oracle's internal state is. This encapsulation is exactly what we want for modeling a quantum oracle—a black box that we can query but whose internal implementation is hidden."

    "A reason **[binary functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_function)** are discussed is that there are many different ways to represent the values **0** and **1**. People often say computers work with zeros and ones, but in practice programming languages expose **[Boolean types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type)** with names such as `true` and `false`. The terminology varies, but the underlying idea — two distinct logical values — is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages also differ in how they treat other values as **[truthy or falsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truthiness)**. For example, an empty list is commonly treated as falsy while a non-empty list is truthy. There is a body of programming-language theory about whether values such as `null` or `None` should be considered true or false. Treating `None` as falsy can hide bugs: a missing reference that should have raised an error may instead behave like `false` and only cause trouble later. For that reason some language designers and programmers prefer to treat `None` (or `null`) as a distinct exceptional case rather than as a simple falsy boolean. In Python, for instance, **[identity checks](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#is)** like `is None` are recommended when the distinction matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many theoretical and physical ways to represent zeros and ones. A standard mathematical representation uses two-dimensional **[column vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_and_column_vectors)** (one column, two rows) to represent the **[basis states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra))**. These are commonly written in **[bra–ket notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%E2%80%93ket_notation)** as `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`. **[Matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics))** are used because they perform mathematical operations: matrices can be multiplied and manipulated to represent operations on these basis vectors. Matrix and vector representations are extremely useful because **[linear-algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra)** operations implement the transformations that are needed when modelling information and information-processing devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "A practical example from **[cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography)** and **[hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function)** was mentioned. In **[Bitcoin mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Mining)** and in secure-hash design (for example **[SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)**), it is desirable that each output bit behaves like an **[unbiased random bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_coin)** — roughly a 50/50 distribution for each bit. The unpredictability of each bit prevents easy guessing of hash outputs; a uniform 50/50 distribution across bits is a design goal for cryptographic hash functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pedagogical reference was made to researchers such as **[John Watrous](https://jhwatrous.github.io/)** who use the column-vector / matrix representation extensively. The shorthand ket notation (for example `|0⟩`, `|1⟩`) is convenient: it is easier to write the ket than the corresponding 2×1 column matrix every time. When using this notation it must be clear which matrix is meant by each ket; the ket is a compact label for the underlying vector and for the matrix operations that act on it.\n",

    "#### Measuring a system in a probabilistic state — explanation and examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, consider what happens when a system is **[measured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics)** while it is in a **[probabilistic state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution)**. Here, *measuring* means looking at the system and recognizing the **[classical state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_information_theory)** it is in without ambiguity. Intuitively, a probabilistic state cannot be \"seen\" directly; when the system is **[observed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_(quantum_physics))**, one sees one of the possible classical states.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a measurement is made, the observer's knowledge about the system changes. If the measurement reveals that the system is in the classical state `a ∈ Σ`, then the **[probability vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_vector)** describing the observer's knowledge becomes the vector with a `1` in the entry for `a` and `0` for all other entries. That vector indicates the system is in the classical state `a` with certainty; this **[standard-basis vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_basis)** is denoted `|a⟩` (read \"ket a\"). Vectors of this form are called **[standard basis vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_basis)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (bit basis):** for a single bit the standard basis vectors are `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`, represented by the column vectors (1, 0)ᵀ and (0, 1)ᵀ respectively. Any two-dimensional column vector can be written as a **[linear combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination)** of these two basis vectors; this generalizes to larger classical state sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Everyday analogy (coin):** suppose a **[fair coin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_coin)** is flipped and then covered. The probabilistic state of the coin (from the observer's perspective) is \"heads with probability 1/2, tails with probability 1/2.\" If the coin is uncovered and the observer sees tails, the observer updates the description of the coin to the standard basis vector `|tails⟩`. If the coin is covered again and later uncovered by the same observer, the classical state remains tails and the description `|tails⟩` remains correct for that observer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This update-of-knowledge perspective is important: probabilistic states describe knowledge or belief, not necessarily an **[ontological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#Philosophical_implications)** superposition of actual classical states. Measuring changes the observer's knowledge. For example, after the coin flip but before looking, the coin is actually either heads or tails — the observer just does not know which. When the observer looks and sees tails, the observer's probability vector becomes `|tails⟩`. To someone who did not see the coin when it was uncovered, the probabilistic state would remain the 50/50 description. Different observers can legitimately have different probability vectors for the same physical system because they have different information. This interpretation is related to **[Bayesian probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability)** and the **[Bayesian interpretation of quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Bayesianism)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this behaviour is straightforward for classical probabilistic systems, quantum systems behave analogously in the sense that measurement yields a definite classical outcome and updates the observer's description. The difference is that **[quantum amplitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_amplitude)** and **[quantum interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference#Quantum_interference)** make the underlying mathematics and the allowed transformations richer; establishing the classical analogue first helps make the quantum case less surprising.\n",

    "**The workflow:**\n",
    "- **Start with:** A bit in some state (represented as a probability vector)\n",
    "- **Apply operation:** Multiply by a matrix (the matrix goes in front)\n",
    "- **Result:** Get a new state (a new probability vector)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real example - the NOT gate:**\n",
    "- Start: A bit that's 0.75 probability of being 0 and 0.25 probability of being 1\n",
    "- Apply a **[NOT operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverter_(logic_gate))** to flip it, even without knowing its exact value\n",
    "- Result: It becomes 0.25 probability of 0 and 0.75 probability of 1\n",
    "- The probabilities swap!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- Operations can be applied to bits even when their exact values are unknown\n",

    "#### Non-Commutativity: Why Order Matters\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$$A \\times B \\neq B \\times A \\quad \\text{(in general)}$$\n",

    "Reversing the order can produce a completely different result.\n",

    "**The Socks and Shoes Analogy:**\n",

    "The best everyday example is getting dressed: *putting on your socks and then your shoes* is **not the same** as *putting on your shoes and then your socks*. The order of operations matters!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly what non-commutativity means in mathematics. Matrices are probably the first mathematical object most people encounter where this property becomes explicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this significant?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-commutative operations appear everywhere in real-world situations. Historically, physicists working on early **[quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics)** were puzzled by this: multiplying two quantities one way gave a different result than multiplying them the other way. Less than 100 years ago, many in the physics community found this genuinely strange — *\"I multiply these two numbers this way and get one result; I multiply them the other way and get a different result!\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "But it turned out that nature itself is non-commutative at the quantum level. There is no deep philosophical reason for it other than: **it works**. In almost every physical situation we try to model, matrix multiplication with its non-commutative property gives us the correct answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does swapping the order change the result?**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you multiply $X \\times Y$, you take **rows** from $X$ and **columns** from $Y$. If you swap to $Y \\times X$, you are now taking rows from $Y$ and columns from $X$ — you are pairing up completely different sets of numbers. Sometimes you can only multiply them one way: if $X$ is $2 \\times 3$ and $Y$ is $3 \\times 4$, then $X \\times Y$ works (result is $2 \\times 4$), but $Y \\times X$ does **not** ($Y$ has 4 columns, $X$ has 2 rows — mismatch!).\n",
