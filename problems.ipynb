    "### Classical vs Quantum Information\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Classical Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_information_theory)** - Think about how a CD or DVD stores music and videos. The disc surface contains tiny physical pits — a pit represents a 0, and a flat area (called a \"land\") represents a 1. When you play the disc, a laser reads these pits one by one, [decoding the binary data sequentially.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/compact-disc) This is how classical computers work: they process information as definite 0s and 1s, checking each value individually. If you wanted to find out whether a mystery function always gives the same answer (constant) or gives a mix of answers (balanced), you would have to test many inputs one at a time — potentially needing up to 9 queries for a 4-input function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Quantum Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information)** - Now imagine you need to decide whether to bring a raincoat before going outside. Classically, you would check the weather forecast first, then decide. But what if you could somehow be prepared for all weather possibilities at once? This is the essence of [quantum superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition) — a quantum bit (qubit) can exist as both 0 AND 1 simultaneously, like being in a state of \"maybe rain, maybe sunshine\" until you observe it. The [Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9708016) exploits this property: by putting qubits into superposition, we can query a function with all possible inputs at once, and through quantum interference, the answer (constant or balanced) reveals itself in just a single query. This is the quantum advantage we will explore in this notebook.\n"

    "\n",
    "A classical system is defined by the set of states it can be in.\n",

    "\n",
    "- If \\(X\\) is a **bit**, then  \n",
    "Σ = \\{0,1\\}\n",
    "\n",
    "- If \\(X\\) is a **six-sided die**, then  \n",

    "\n",
    "- If \\(X\\) is a **fan switch**, then  \n",

    "The physical representation does not matter — only the distinct states matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "“A bit is just a system that can be in two different states.”\n",

    "### 2. When We Know the State Exactly\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we know the state with certainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "If the fan switch is set to *high*, we know the exact classical state.\n",

    "\n",
    "Real-world information is often uncertain. You cannot predict incoming bits. If you could predict them, the channel would carry less information (because information = unpredictability).\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we believe:\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of \\(X=0\\) is $ \\Pr(X=0) = \\frac{3}{4} $, and the probability of $X=1$ is $ \\Pr(X=1) = \\frac{1}{4} $.\n",
