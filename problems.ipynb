    "### Classical vs Quantum Information\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Classical Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_information_theory)** - Think about how a CD or DVD stores music and videos. The disc surface contains tiny physical pits — a pit represents a 0, and a flat area (called a \"land\") represents a 1. When you play the disc, a laser reads these pits one by one, [decoding the binary data sequentially.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/compact-disc) This is how classical computers work: they process information as definite 0s and 1s, checking each value individually. If you wanted to find out whether a mystery function always gives the same answer (constant) or gives a mix of answers (balanced), you would have to test many inputs one at a time — potentially needing up to 9 queries for a 4-input function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Quantum Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information)** - Now imagine you need to decide whether to bring a raincoat before going outside. Classically, you would check the weather forecast first, then decide. But what if you could somehow be prepared for all weather possibilities at once? This is the essence of [quantum superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition) — a **[quantum bit (qubit)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit)** can exist as both 0 AND 1 simultaneously, like being in a state of \"maybe rain, maybe sunshine\" until you observe it. The [Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9708016) exploits this property: by putting qubits into superposition, we can query a function with all possible inputs at once, and through **[quantum interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference#Quantum_interference)**, the answer (constant or balanced) reveals itself in just a single query. This is the **[quantum advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy)** we will explore in this notebook.\n"

    "#### Variadic Functions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are Variadic Functions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **[variadic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_function)** is a function that accepts an arbitrary (variable) number of arguments. In languages like **[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))**, you typically must declare the exact number and type of arguments in the function signature (e.g., `int i, char c, char* s`). However, some functions—such as C's famous `printf`—can accept any number of arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference:** The concept of variadic functions dates back to early programming languages and is essential for flexible APIs. C's `printf` function is perhaps the most well-known example, using **[variable argument lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stdarg.h)** (`<stdarg.h>`) to handle formatting strings with any number of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python's `*args` Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides syntax for creating variadic functions using the **asterisk operator (`*`)** before an argument name. The most common convention is to name this parameter `*args`, though any valid name can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "- The `*` prefix tells Python to collect all positional arguments into a **[tuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple)**\n",
    "- Inside the function, `args` becomes a tuple containing all the passed arguments\n",
    "- You can pass any number of arguments (including zero)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple demonstration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function(*args):\n",
    "    print(args)\n",
    "\n",
    "function(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference:** This syntax is part of Python's **[argument unpacking](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#unpacking-argument-lists)** features, documented in **[PEP 3132](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3132/)** and extensively covered in resources like **[Real Python's guide to *args and **kwargs](https://realpython.com/python-kwargs-and-args/)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Explosion (Unpacking) Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The asterisk `*` serves **two roles** in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Packing (in function definitions):** `def f(*args)` — collects multiple arguments into one tuple\n",
    "2. **Unpacking (in function calls):** `f(*my_list)` — expands a list/tuple into separate arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "This second use is sometimes called the **\"explosion operator\"** because it \"explodes\" a collection into individual elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add_three(a, b, c):\n",
    "    return a + b + c\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "result = add_three(*numbers)  # Same as add_three(1, 2, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** The `*` here is NOT a dereference operator like in C/C++. In Python, it's specifically for argument packing/unpacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Helpers bin_args_to_int and closure fclosure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**  \n",
    "- `bin_args_to_int` converts a binary argument list into an integer index for tuple lookup.  \n",
    "- `fclosure` creates a **[closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming))** that implements a fixed random oracle (constant or balanced) on $n$ bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference:** The encoding technique converts **[binary numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number)** to **[decimal indices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation)** for array lookup—a standard indexing strategy. The closure pattern captures the random tuple in its **[lexical scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#Lexical_scope)**, modeling the \"black box\" oracle paradigm central to **[query complexity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_complexity)** and quantum algorithms (see [Quantum Algorithm Zoo](https://quantumalgorithmzoo.org/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why `bin_args_to_int` uses `*args`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `bin_args_to_int` function demonstrates variadic functions perfectly:\n",
    "- It doesn't know in advance how many binary inputs it will receive\n",
    "- It accepts any number of boolean/truthy values\n",
    "- The function works for 1 bit, 3 bits, 4 bits, or any $n$ bits\n",
    "- This flexibility is essential for the quantum oracle abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accepts variadic input:** `*args` collects all binary arguments into a tuple\n",
    "2. **Converts to binary string:** Each argument is evaluated as truthy (→ '1') or falsy (→ '0')\n",
    "3. **Parses as integer:** The binary string is converted to a decimal index using `int(bits, 2)`\n",
    "4. **Returns the index:** This index is used to look up the oracle's output in the pre-generated tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bin_args_to_int(1, 0, 1)  # Args: (1, 0, 1)\n",
    "# → bits = '101'\n",
    "# → int('101', 2) = 5\n",
    "# → returns 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical notes:**\n",
    "- Closure pattern: `f_a` is fixed when `fclosure` is called; the returned `f` uses that fixed tuple, modeling an oracle.\n",
    "- Indexing convention: the first argument corresponds to the most-significant bit in the binary string; maintain this ordering consistently.\n",
    "- The variadic design allows the same `bin_args_to_int` function to work with any $n$-bit oracle without modification."

    "A reason **[binary functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_function)** are discussed is that there are many different ways to represent the values **0** and **1**. People often say computers work with zeros and ones, but in practice programming languages expose **[Boolean types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type)** with names such as `true` and `false`. The terminology varies, but the underlying idea — two distinct logical values — is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages also differ in how they treat other values as **[truthy or falsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truthiness)**. For example, an empty list is commonly treated as falsy while a non-empty list is truthy. There is a body of programming-language theory about whether values such as `null` or `None` should be considered true or false. Treating `None` as falsy can hide bugs: a missing reference that should have raised an error may instead behave like `false` and only cause trouble later. For that reason some language designers and programmers prefer to treat `None` (or `null`) as a distinct exceptional case rather than as a simple falsy boolean. In Python, for instance, **[identity checks](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#is)** like `is None` are recommended when the distinction matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many theoretical and physical ways to represent zeros and ones. A standard mathematical representation uses two-dimensional **[column vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_and_column_vectors)** (one column, two rows) to represent the **[basis states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra))**. These are commonly written in **[bra–ket notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%E2%80%93ket_notation)** as `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`. **[Matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics))** are used because they perform mathematical operations: matrices can be multiplied and manipulated to represent operations on these basis vectors. Matrix and vector representations are extremely useful because **[linear-algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra)** operations implement the transformations that are needed when modelling information and information-processing devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "A practical example from **[cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography)** and **[hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function)** was mentioned. In **[Bitcoin mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Mining)** and in secure-hash design (for example **[SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)**), it is desirable that each output bit behaves like an **[unbiased random bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_coin)** — roughly a 50/50 distribution for each bit. The unpredictability of each bit prevents easy guessing of hash outputs; a uniform 50/50 distribution across bits is a design goal for cryptographic hash functions.\n",

    "A pedagogical reference was made to researchers such as **[John Watrous](https://jhwatrous.github.io/)** who use the column-vector / matrix representation extensively. The shorthand ket notation (for example `|0⟩`, `|1⟩`) is convenient: it is easier to write the ket than the corresponding 2×1 column matrix every time. When using this notation it must be clear which matrix is meant by each ket; the ket is a compact label for the underlying vector and for the matrix operations that act on it.\n",

    "#### Measuring a system in a probabilistic state — explanation and examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, consider what happens when a system is **[measured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics)** while it is in a **[probabilistic state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution)**. Here, *measuring* means looking at the system and recognizing the **[classical state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_information_theory)** it is in without ambiguity. Intuitively, a probabilistic state cannot be \"seen\" directly; when the system is **[observed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_(quantum_physics))**, one sees one of the possible classical states.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a measurement is made, the observer's knowledge about the system changes. If the measurement reveals that the system is in the classical state `a ∈ Σ`, then the **[probability vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_vector)** describing the observer's knowledge becomes the vector with a `1` in the entry for `a` and `0` for all other entries. That vector indicates the system is in the classical state `a` with certainty; this **[standard-basis vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_basis)** is denoted `|a⟩` (read \"ket a\"). Vectors of this form are called **[standard basis vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_basis)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (bit basis):** for a single bit the standard basis vectors are `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`, represented by the column vectors (1, 0)ᵀ and (0, 1)ᵀ respectively. Any two-dimensional column vector can be written as a **[linear combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination)** of these two basis vectors; this generalizes to larger classical state sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Everyday analogy (coin):** suppose a **[fair coin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_coin)** is flipped and then covered. The probabilistic state of the coin (from the observer's perspective) is \"heads with probability 1/2, tails with probability 1/2.\" If the coin is uncovered and the observer sees tails, the observer updates the description of the coin to the standard basis vector `|tails⟩`. If the coin is covered again and later uncovered by the same observer, the classical state remains tails and the description `|tails⟩` remains correct for that observer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This update-of-knowledge perspective is important: probabilistic states describe knowledge or belief, not necessarily an **[ontological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#Philosophical_implications)** superposition of actual classical states. Measuring changes the observer's knowledge. For example, after the coin flip but before looking, the coin is actually either heads or tails — the observer just does not know which. When the observer looks and sees tails, the observer's probability vector becomes `|tails⟩`. To someone who did not see the coin when it was uncovered, the probabilistic state would remain the 50/50 description. Different observers can legitimately have different probability vectors for the same physical system because they have different information. This interpretation is related to **[Bayesian probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability)** and the **[Bayesian interpretation of quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Bayesianism)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this behaviour is straightforward for classical probabilistic systems, quantum systems behave analogously in the sense that measurement yields a definite classical outcome and updates the observer's description. The difference is that **[quantum amplitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_amplitude)** and **[quantum interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference#Quantum_interference)** make the underlying mathematics and the allowed transformations richer; establishing the classical analogue first helps make the quantum case less surprising.\n",

    "#### Why Matrix Multiplication is Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Probability vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_vector)** are combined with matrices to represent operations applied to bits. The matrix represents an operation that transforms the bit's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The workflow:**\n",
    "- **Start with:** A bit in some state (represented as a probability vector)\n",
    "- **Apply operation:** Multiply by a matrix (the matrix goes in front)\n",
    "- **Result:** Get a new state (a new probability vector)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real example - the NOT gate:**\n",
    "- Start: A bit that's 0.75 probability of being 0 and 0.25 probability of being 1\n",
    "- Apply a **[NOT operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverter_(logic_gate))** to flip it, even without knowing its exact value\n",
    "- Result: It becomes 0.25 probability of 0 and 0.75 probability of 1\n",
    "- The probabilities swap!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- Operations can be applied to bits even when their exact values are unknown\n",
    "- In quantum computing, bits are often in uncertain states (**[superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition)**)\n",
    "- A mathematical way is needed to describe what happens when operations are applied to these uncertain states\n",
    "- **[Matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication)** provides that tool\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Matrix Multiplication - A Concrete Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's exactly how matrix multiplication works with a real example using two 3×3 matrices 3 rows by 3 columns:\n",

    "**Matrix A:**\n",

    "[ 1  4  8 ]\n",
    "[ 2  9  6 ]\n",
    "[ 3  5  7 ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The core concept: Dot Product**\n",
    "\n",
    "The key operation is the **[dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product)**:\n",
    "- Take a row from the first matrix (a list of numbers)\n",
    "- Take a column from the second matrix (another list of numbers)\n",
    "- Multiply corresponding entries together\n",
    "- Add up all those products\n",
    "- That sum becomes one entry in the result\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Identify the row and column:**\n",
    "   - Target: row 2, column 1 of the result\n",
    "   - Take **row 2 from matrix A**: [9, 2, 1]\n",
    "   - Take **column 1 from matrix B**: [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiply corresponding entries:**\n",
    "   - First entries: 9 × 1 = 9\n",
    "   - Second entries: 2 × 2 = 4\n",
    "   - Third entries: 1 × 3 = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add them all up:**\n",
    "   - Sum: 9 + 4 + 3 = **16**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Place the result:**\n",
    "   - The answer 16 goes into **row 2, column 1** of the result matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**The complete result matrix (A × B):**\n",

    "[ 25   85   85 ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How all entries are calculated:**\n",
    "- For **each position** (i, j) in the result matrix:\n",
    "  - Take **row i** from matrix A\n",
    "  - Take **column j** from matrix B\n",
    "  - Do the dot product\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dimension compatibility:** The number of columns in the first matrix MUST equal the number of rows in the second matrix\n",
    "  - Why? Because when doing the dot product, the same number of values is needed in each list\n",
    "  - Example: A is 3×3, B is 3×3\n",
    "  - A has 3 columns, B has 3 rows → They match! \n",
    "  - The result will be 3×3 (rows from A × columns from B)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Order matters:** A × B is usually different from B × A\n",
    "  - Matrix multiplication is NOT **[commutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property)**\n",
    "  - Always be careful about which matrix goes first\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The process is systematic:**\n",
    "  - Row from first matrix, column from second matrix\n",
    "  - Always in that order\n",
    "  - The position (row, column) in the result corresponds to which row and column were picked\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this works for quantum computing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- When complex systems have numbers that interact in messy ways, matrix multiplication handles it systematically\n",
    "- It's a universal mathematical tool that captures how **[quantum states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state)** transform\n",
    "- The matrices represent **[quantum gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)** (operations)\n",
    "- The vectors represent quantum states\n",
    "- Multiplying them together shows what happens after the operation\n",
    "- This framework is why **[linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra)** is so central to quantum computing!"
